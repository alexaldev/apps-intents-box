A simple launcher which displays all the apps on a `RecyclerView` trying to KISS.

## Feature requests

* Hidden apps: Ability to enable/disable visibility of any app on the main list.

* Listen for new installations
: Register a `Receiver` to listen for new installations and act accordingly. 

* Permanent storage of usages 
: Either stay with `File` or move to `SharedPreferences`

* Grid/List display 
: Ability to switch between grid (dynamic number of columns based on device) and list presentation
